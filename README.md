## ✨ What is AFKPal?

**AFKPal** is a tiny Windows app that keeps your computer from going idle by gently simulating activity in the background. It helps you:

- 🧍‍♂️ Stay “Available” on Teams and Zoom
- 💻 Prevent the screen from dimming or locking
- 🧘‍♀️ Step away without your computer falling asleep

Built for remote workers, deep thinkers, and anyone who’s tired of being marked as AFK (away from keyboard) when they’re not.
