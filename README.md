## ✨ What is AFKPal?

**AFKPal** is a tiny Windows app that **keeps your computer awake and your online status always active** — even if you walk away for a few minutes (or hours).

It works with:
- 🟢 **Microsoft Teams**
- 💬 **Slack**
- 🎥 **Zoom**
- 💻 Any app or system that tracks inactivity

No more status flipping to “Away” when you're in deep work, reading, or just stretching your legs.
